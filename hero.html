                Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist,
                a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries,
                a company originally started by his father, Howard Stark.
                A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
                as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist.
                With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, 
                Stark was one of the world's most powerful men, and enjoyed the playboy 
                lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan,
                while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line,
                Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors.
                Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists,
                as well as his traitorous business associate Obadiah Stane. Stark enjoyed the
                fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world,
                 publicly announcing himself as Iron Man.

            <h3>
                Armors 
            </h3>
     <h4>mark-I</h4>       
     <p2> 
   <img src="img src/mark-1.jpg" class="armr">
    The very first of the armor. made inside a cave by the assests given by Ten rings.
    With the help of Ho Yinsen, Tony instead builds the Mark I suit. With time running out,
    Yinsen sacrifices himself to allow Tony time to bring the suit online.
    Once it is, Tony fights his way out, killing many members of the Ten Rings and destroying their weapons stockpile.
    As the stockpile explodes, Tony flies off in the Mark I but it crashes in the desert and is destroyed.
    A few weeks later, he builds the Mark II Armor. The suit has better weapons systems and propulsion.
    It has no computer systems inside.

   <h4>Mark-IV</h4>

    <img src="img src/mark-4.jpg" class="armr">
    The Mark IV (Mark 4) was the fourth Iron Man Armor designed and created by Tony Stark as the successor to older Mark III model.
    Stark used the armor to jump out of a plane for his entrance at the Stark Expo opening. Upon landing,
    the armor's pieces are detached off him by mechanical arms that keep the armor under the stage.
    Stark later got drunk in the armor at his birthday party because of the radiation from the Arc reactor killing him and,
    believing that day to be his last, decided to enjoy it.

<h4> mark-XLII</h4>
    <p2>  
    <img src="img src/mark XLII.jpg" class="armr">
    The Mark 42 (XLII), known by its code name "Extremis" or the “Prodigal Son” is an Autonomous Prehensile Propulsion Suit Prototype was the forty second armor,
    as well as one of the many newly built suits, created by Tony Stark sometime after the events of The Avengers.
    It was the armor featured in the movie Iron Man 3, and made its debut in the movie during the start,
     when Tony creates it in his basement, and tests the suit's functionalities.
      It was seen throughout the whole movie as Tony's main suit, and it was later destroyed by self-destruction 
      when Tony ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to do so, after mentally controlling it to trap Aldrich Killian within it to blow him up and finish him for good.

<h4> mark-XLVI</h4>
    <p2> 
    <img src="img src/mark XLVI.jpg" class="armr">
    When Stark finally assembled his team, he donned the armor and led his teammates into battle against Captain Rogers in the Leipzig Airport in Germany.
     During the battle, the armor sustained minor damage due to Wanda Maximoff dropping cars onto it.This is the first armor to have a fully retractable helmet.
     The armor uses the F.R.I.D.A.Y. O.S. like the Mark 45.
     Barnes then attempted to pull out the armor's main arc reactor with his metallic arm,
     intending to shut down the suit, but Stark unleashed his unibeam disintegrating the majority of
    the arm before downing him with a standard repulsor blast. Fed up with Rogers' constant interference,
    Stark ordered FRIDAY to analyze Rogers' fighting style to predict his moves and exploit his weaknesses.
    After she had done so, Stark promptly beat Rogers half to death to the point where he coughed up blood yet refused
    to stay down. As Stark prepared to kill Rogers, a last second distraction by Barnes allowed the 
    Captain turn the tide of the battle using his shield to smash open the helmet and crush the main arc reactor.

<h4> hulkbuster</h4>

    <img src="img src/hulkbuster.jpg" class="armr">
    The Mark 44 (XLIV), also known as the "Hulkbuster," is an Extra Heavy-Duty Modular Armor created by Tony Stark 
    and Bruce Banner as a security safeguard in the event of an uncontrollable Hulk rampage.
    The armor works by attaching itself to the base armor of the Mark 43.
    The armor was featured in Avengers: Age of Ultron, wherein it was used through Veronica's 
    activation to subdue a rampaging Hulk in South Africa.
    The Mark 44 is eleven feet high, which makes it the tallest armor to date. 
    Its height is 3 feet taller than the Hulk. Aside from its height, 
    it is also the heaviest armor existing in the MCU. The Hulkbuster is a
     Modular Armor wherein armor pieces are attached to a base armor making it much bigger.
